### ⭐ Situation:
As part of the module assessment, I was required to record myself responding to a series of common interview questions to simulate a real interview scenario.

I prepared by researching the company and position I pretended to apply for, practiced multiple takes to improve delivery, and made sure my answers showcased my skills, experiences, and problem-solving abilities.

### ✅ Result:
The recorded interview helped me identify areas for improvement, such as pacing and tone, while reinforcing my strengths in preparation and confidence. This exercise was invaluable for improving my real-world interview performance.
