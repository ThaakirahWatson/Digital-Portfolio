## üí¨ Reflection (STAR)
‚≠ê Situation:
As I approached the final stages of my academic journey, I realized I was uncertain about which specific career paths in the ICT industry were best suited to my strengths and interests. While I had developed a solid foundation in programming and UI/UX design, I needed clarity on how these skills could be aligned with real-world roles.

üéØ Task:
I needed to identify my core skills, personal interests, and how they could translate into professional opportunities. This required honest self-assessment and exploration of the types of roles that matched my natural abilities and the technical competencies I had gained through coursework and practical projects.

‚öôÔ∏è Action:
To achieve this, I completed a structured in-class module and a LinkedIn Learning course focused on skills and career alignment. These activities involved using tools like a skills matrix, interest mapping, and career profiling techniques to gain a better understanding of where I could thrive. I also reflected on the practical skills I acquired through various academic projects‚Äîranging from backend development in PHP and Java to front-end design using Figma‚Äîand assessed which tasks I enjoyed and excelled at the most.

‚úÖ Result:
Through this process, I discovered that I have a strong affinity for analytical thinking, attention to detail, and system-based problem solving. These insights led me to consider career paths such as Quality Assurance (QA), Systems Analysis, and even Product Design, where my technical knowledge and user-focused mindset can be fully utilized. The reflection exercises gave me a clearer sense of direction and more confidence in pursuing roles that not only suit my abilities but also excite me.
