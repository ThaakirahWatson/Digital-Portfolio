⭐ Situation:
As I progressed through my studies in ICT, I found myself uncertain about which specific career roles would best suit me. While I had developed a broad range of technical skills, I wanted to ensure that the career path I pursued would also align with my personality and working style.

⚙️ Action:
To address this, I completed an in-class course focused on personality assessment. Through guided self-evaluation tools and personality profiling exercises, I identified key traits such as my preference for structure, attention to detail, and problem-solving mindset. I then explored how these traits mapped to various roles within ICT, such as systems analysis, software testing, and UX design.

The assessment gave me valuable insight into my personal tendencies and how they align with analytical, detail-oriented roles in ICT. As a result, I gained confidence in exploring career paths like Quality Assurance, Business/Systems Analysis, and User Experience Design, where I can combine both my technical skills and personality strengths to thrive professionally.
